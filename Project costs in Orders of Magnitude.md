# Project costs in Orders of Magnitude

*This idea is partially stolen from Merlin Mann’s rule of thumb of orders of magnitude in pricing as described on Do By Friday episode 78*

I’ve worked with a lot of non-profits and one of the things NPOs always need is video production. NPOs live and die in their abilities to tell their stories and a video is an incredibly powerful tool in crafting their message and presenting it to the world. I have sat in many meeting where people who don’t know much about video production, talk about the need for a video and it always makes me really uncomfortable. The reason why is that often times, these people don’t understand how projects scale in orders of magnitude. People will talk about doing a video (or a creating a website for that matter) as if it’s something that can be accomplished in a few days or a week or so, when in reality, they are describing a 2 or 3 month project. The disconnect between those realities, always makes me very nervous, like I’m seeing a horrible future tragedy eminently about to happen. I’ve learned to calmly listen, take notes, and listen to their ideas because that ideation is really important. The lack of scale can be addressed at a later date.

## (Rough) Orders of Magnitude in Pricing

I heard Merlin Mann describe a method for pricing client work in this really clever way. If the client **really** can’t come up with a price for what they think they can budget for the project, just start increasing the price in orders of magnitude.
“Do you want to pay $1 for your website?” 
“Do you want to pay $100 for your website?”
“Do you want to pay $1,000 for your website?”
“Do you want to pay $10,000 for your website?”
“Do you want to pay **$100,000** for your website?”
“Do you want to pay **$1,000,000** for your website?”

At some point the client going to reach a price ceiling they're uncomfortable with and you’ll have a range that you’re able to work from. I’m not making any kind of judgement about the budget of any kind of project. There are legitimate reasons to charge every scale of budget for a project. We price projects out in regards to time required and/or effort required and I think it’s likely those also scale in similar orders of magnitude. 

The real trouble with you run into is whenever a client think the job their describing is $1,000 job, and you know it’s a $10,000 or even a $100,000 job. I think most people who’ve done client work know this feeling and will tell you it’s incredibly awkward and uncomfortable. It’s an odd feeling to have someone who doesn’t understand what you do be certain that it won’t take as long or be as difficult as you’re saying it will be.

People are pretty much all inflicted with the inability to estimate how much time or effort things are going cost. Thinking about costs and time frames in terms of orders of magnitude has been a helpful rubric for judging whether a project is right for me or not. The next time you’re doing some sort of ideation, maybe step back and try and estimate what order of magnitude for cost this person is assuming they’re going to pay. You might be surprised and it will likely help you to set expectations early on before things get out of control.
