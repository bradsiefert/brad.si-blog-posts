# Twice as Long, at Half Power
Many of my close friends think of me not as a technology enthusiast, but as an Apple enthusiast. And I do love me some Apple hardware. Today though, I’m not here to talk about some elegant, beautiful piece of industrial engineering, conceived directly from the mind of Dieter Rams—no. I want to talk about one of the most common, but useful pieces of technology we almost all have‚ the microwave. There’s a trick that I found, I’m sure that many others have as well, but it’s an idea I want to spread. 

Here’s the tip: when you’re reheating nearly anything in the microwave, cook it for **twice as long, at half the power** you think you need. Believe me. It works. 

Food warms up more slowly, more evenly, and you’re much less likely to have a scolding hot food or container. I think most of us have experienced some reheated food that’s too hot in one place and not warm in others. It’s gross. Never again. 

So, even if you’re 100% with me, I can hear an objection you might have: “I don’t know how to turn down the power on my microwave.” Someone else is going to say, “Wait, you can decrease the power of a microwave?” I’ve tested this out on dozens of microwaves and I’ve yet to find one that it hasn’t worked on yet. There’s a specific sequence that your microwave requires of you if you want to use a lower power. Here it is: 

## Lower Power Cooking Sequence
1. Press “Time Cook”
2. Enter time.
3. Press “Power”
4. Press 5 on the keypad to lessen the power. 
(Pressing 5 is 50% power. Three will be 30% power, etc.)
5. Press “Start”

This sequence seems obvious, but I’ve been shocked how many people didn’t know it. I think it’s a pretty ubiquitously programmed this way among most modern microwaves. Try it out, see if it works for you. It made me so happy when I figured this out, hope it does the same for you.
