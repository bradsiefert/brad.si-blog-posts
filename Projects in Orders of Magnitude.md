# Projects in Orders of Magnitude

*This idea is partially stolen from Merlin Mann’s idea of orders of magnitude in pricing as described on Do By Friday episode 102*

I’ve worked with a lot of non-profits and one of the things NPOs always need is video production. NPOs live and die in their abilities to tell their stories and a video is an incredibly powerful tool in crafting their message and presenting it to the world. I have sat in many meeting where people who don’t know hardly anything about video, talk about the need for a video and it always makes me really uncomfortable. The reason why is none of these people understand how projects scale in orders of magnitude. They speak about doing a video (or a website for that matter) as if it’s something that can be accomplished in a few days or a week or so, when in reality, they are describing a 2 or 3 month project. The disconnect between those realities, always makes me nervous and scared, like I’m seeing a horrible future tragedy eminently about to happen. I’ve learned to calmly listen, take notes, and listen to their idea because that ideation is really important. Their lack of understanding of scale can be addressed at a later date.

## (Rough) Orders of Magnitude in Pricing
| $1 | $100 | $1,000 | $100,000 | $1,000,000 |

I heard Merlin Mann describe a method for pricing client work in this really clever way. If the client **really** can’t come up with a price for what they think they can budget for the project, just start increasing the price in orders of magnitude.
“Do you want to pay $1 for your website?” 
“Do you want to pay $100 for your website?”
“Do you want to pay $1,000 for your website?”
“Do you want to pay $10,000 for your website?”
“Do you want to pay **$100,000** for your website?”

At some point the client going to reach a price ceiling they're uncomfortable with and you’ll have a range that you’re able to work from. I’m not making any kind of judgement about the budget of any kind of project. There are legitimate reasons to charge every scale of budget for a project, but we almost always price projects out in regards to time worked and/or effort required and I think those too scale in similar orders of magnitude. 

The real trouble with you run into is whenever a client think the job their describing is $1,000 job, and you know it’s a $10,000 or even a $100,000 job. I think most people who’ve done client work know this feeling and will tell you it’s incredibly awkward and uncomfortable. It’s an odd feeling to have someone who doesn’t understand what you do be certain that it won’t take as long or be as difficult as you’re saying it will be.

Going back to video. Video is a perfect example of this principle. Obviously, people shoot video for essentially free, all day long. They post it, share it, and it shapes the world we live.
